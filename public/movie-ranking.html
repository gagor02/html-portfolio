<h1>The Best Movies According To Gabriel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>FLOW</h3>
<p>“Flow,” Latvia’s entry for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars, shimmers with the essence of life and the spirit of selfless cooperation. Its narrative clarity makes its fable seem timeless, while innovating and expanding the visual immersion of its medium. Starring an expressive black cat, who presumably had an adoring human owner, as its protagonist, “Flow” introduces us to a land devoid of people. Evidence that they once inhabited this forest area exists, but we are likely observing a post-humanity timeline as the Earth heals itself from our transgressions.</p>

<h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</h3>
<p>At the film’s start, the red-striped Shadow breaks out of Prison Island, where he’s been held for the past 50 years, seeking revenge. Sonic, Knuckles (an endearingly goofy Idris Elba) and the perky Tails (Colleen O’Shaughnessy) have been enjoying a quiet life in small-town Green Hills, Montana, with Tom (James Marsden) and his wife, Maddie (Tika Sumpter). Aside from Carrey’s characters, the human beings are less necessary than ever this time.  </p>

<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>Riding a wave of gorgeous visuals from the legendary Roger Deakins and a crack effects team, Villeneuve brings us to Los Angeles in 2049. It’s been decades since the action of the first film, but the replicant-destroying Blade Runner is still a profession, personified here by Ryan Gosling as an agent known as K. His duty now is to track down old replicants who have gone into hiding, living long past their originally-programmed lifespan. In the film’s opening, Officer K tracks down a replicant who is just trying to live a peaceful life as a farmer (a spectacled Dave Bautista, doing a great deal with a small role). What he finds there will start what is essentially a detective story, spurring K to solve a mystery about his own past, the history of replicants, the power of memory, and what it means to be a human being. Robin Wright, Jared Leto, and Harrison Ford co-star.</p>
<p>From the minute footage of “Blade Runner 2049” started to leak, it was clear that the director of “Prisoners” and “Arrival” had created a film with a confident, strong visual language. </p>
